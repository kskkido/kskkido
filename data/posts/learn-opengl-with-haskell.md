## Context
As a web developer I've always been interested in learning OpenGL to understand how websites use WebGL to create crazy animations and interactions. I worked my way through parts of the [WebGL Fundamentals](https://webglfundamentals.org/) website using [Purescript in the past](https://github.com/kskkido/webgl-fundamentals-purescript), but unfortunately I forgot most of what I learned and even while it was fresh in my mind I didn't have a good understanding of the technology that WebGL is based on. I knew that the [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) book was the go to material for learning OpenGL, but I wasn't that keen on picking up C++ just to learn the concept, so I decided to go through the book using Haskell. Thankfully there was a [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/dmjio/LearnOpenGL.hs/tree/master) that ported parts of the book into Haskell so I wasn't completely on my own. My attempt is still a work in progress, but its available as a [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/kskkido/learn-opengl-haskell/tree/main)
